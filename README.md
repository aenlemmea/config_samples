## Config Samples

Earlier these were my dotfiles. Currently I have migrated to a different setup.

The VIM/NVIM clipboard is setup according to WSL2 with [win32yank](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank) and requires it being installed on Winwdows.
I use TAB_RS over GNU Screen due to its ease of use.

Although this repo is supposed to be archived, I do update the configs to fix/update/migrate accordingly from time to time hence.
